## Data
Spotify releases this dataset in the Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge. As the dataset is very large (e.g. 130 million listening sessions), I will not store it here at the github. If you are interested, please check out their website [https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge).
