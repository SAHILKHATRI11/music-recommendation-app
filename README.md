This repository contains the content of music recommendation system I develop using deep reinforcement learning algorithm. You can read the blog at https://medium.com/@paige.c.chang/music-box-8576d5d1233d.

The recommendation system is trained off-line using Spotify dataset(https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge). In the data foler, you can find a set of training dataset composing 2 millions user listening session and look up table for song features of 4 millions song tracks.
