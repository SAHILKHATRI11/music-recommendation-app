#Maybe add some more description here. Is the model deployed? Where can I find it? Address some technical questions? performance?

## Description
MusicBox is my project as an AI fellow at Insight Data Science. The goal of the project is to build a new generation of recommendation system that learns sequential patterns of user behavior using reinforcement learning. You can read more about the project at my [blog](https://medium.com/@paige.c.chang/music-box-8576d5d1233d).

## Data
Spotify releases this dataset in the Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge. As the dataset is very large (e.g. 130 million listening sessions), I will not store it here on github. If you are interested, please check out their website [https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge).
